The main goal of the software is to find a simple way to help users easily, In order for the programmer to get this method he must understand the programming well and use it correctly and in a simple way and in the least possible time by using the appropriate code and be aware of it when maintaining it, The programmer must understand the problem first then solve it in clear steps, and start doing so gradually so that he does not face difficulties, In the end a programmer can only become good if he searches for the solutions that confront him.
